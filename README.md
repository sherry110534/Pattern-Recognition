# Pattern Recognition

- HW1: Design the Maximum A Posterior  (MAP) classifier for the [UCI-Sonar ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))dataset (2 classes,  60 features) if 75% of the data are used in the training phase, and the rest are used to evaluate.  The deadline is 23th April.

- HW2: (a) Compute Bhattacharyya distance for the [UCI-Sonar](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))[ ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))dataset;  (b) Compute Bhattacharyya  and Chernoff  error bound  for the [UCI-Sonar](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))[ ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))dataset. And have a discussion with HW1. The deadline is 14th May.

- HW3: Single layer perceptron for the UCI-Sonar dataset. Please compare the result with HW1. The deadline is 28th May.

- HW4: Self-Organizing Map Network for the IRIS and Sonar datasets. The deadline is 10th June.
